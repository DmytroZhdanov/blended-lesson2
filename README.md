# Lesson 2. Plan

- Kahoot
- Q&A Session
- Practical Session

> Before starting the practical session, familiarize yourself with the library
> [react-tabs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tabs), used in the
> **Basic Example** in the App to separate the two tasks. You'll also need to
> obtain a key from [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/api/) - for working with
> the Image Search exercise. In both tasks, we'll be reusing
> components `<SearchFormStyled/>` and styled-components `Grid` and `GridItem`

## Tasks

- [Task 1 - Image Search](./task%231.md)
- [Task 2 - TODO LIST](./task%232.md)
